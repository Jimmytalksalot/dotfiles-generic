# Optimization
If your Linux system is running slow, here are some things you can do to fix that.

1: Use cpufrequtils. This app allows you to control CPU usage, and therefore switch modes to use more power, and less power. You can use performance mode to get the highest CPU performance on your Linux system.

2: Use lightweight alternatives. If you use code editors, like VSC or Zed, you should switch to lighter alternatives like Neovim, Nano, or terminal-based text editors. This can help use less power and also have more performant usage of apps in your workflow.

3: Use fewer apps, because just by using fewer apps, you reduce memory usage, and therefore have more RAM to do things that actually benefit you. If you have a random game open, then close it.

4: Reboot from time to time. Sometimes, loading Linux for a long time can cause issues, so reboot it every week, or every day if you see any performance issues.

5: Update software. Some app updates actually include performance updates to them as well, therefore, updating apps may improve performance.

Use the install script that comes with the folder, if it's not there, than manually copy files into your .config directory.
