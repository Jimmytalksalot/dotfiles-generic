# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles for i3-wm, and other things alike, this is one my first rices in my journey of using Linux.


# Dotfiles-Everest

This rice is one of my older ones, it was terrible, and non-productive for me, it also had a bland design and lacked many useful things, though, if you still want to use it, it's right here, it contains all the dots including the wallpapers.

**Old rice** 

Now, while the main branch does contain an old folder, it only contains my old i3 and polybar configs, not the ones I used in my full setup. Tinker around with these old configuration files, and do whatever, I do not care.



# Installation.

```polybag rofi i3-wm i3lock neovim kitty picom```

Also, make sure to install the font labelled in the configuration files...

# Other

This rice was made by someone who barely knows how to use i3, so giving suggestions would really help me out, if you can, give me suggestions on this Reddit post.
